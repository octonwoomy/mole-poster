                <h2>Definition</h2>
                <p>A mole is a unit of measurement used in chemistry to express amounts of a chemical substance. One
                    mole of any substance contains <strong>Avogadro's number</strong> of entities, which is
                    approximately 6.02 × 10^23.</p>

                <h2>Definition of Avogadro's Number</h2>
                <p>Avogadro's number, denoted as <strong>N<sub>A</sub></strong>, is the number of atoms, ions, or
                    molecules in one mole of a substance. It is approximately 6.02 × 10^23.</p>

                <h2>Interesting Fact about the Mole (Number)</h2>
                <p>One interesting fact about Avogadro's number is that it is <strong>independent of the substance being
                        measured</strong>. Whether you're talking about atoms, molecules, ions, or even something else
                    entirely, one mole of that substance will always contain the same number of entities, which is
                    Avogadro's number.</p>
